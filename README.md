# Property History Ledger

## Project Description

The Property History Ledger is a decentralized smart contract system built on the Ethereum blockchain that provides a transparent, immutable, and secure way to track property ownership and transaction history. This system enables property registration, ownership transfers, and maintains a complete audit trail of all property-related transactions.

The smart contract eliminates the need for traditional centralized property registries by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure data integrity, prevent fraud, and provide public access to property ownership information. Each property transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain, creating an unalterable history that can be verified by anyone.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize property management and ownership tracking by creating a decentralized, transparent, and efficient system that:

- **Eliminates Fraud**: Prevents property fraud through immutable blockchain records
- **Increases Transparency**: Provides public access to property ownership and transaction history
- **Reduces Bureaucracy**: Streamlines property transfers without intermediaries
- **Ensures Security**: Leverages blockchain security to protect property records
- **Global Accessibility**: Enables cross-border property transactions and verification

We envision a future where property ownership is as simple and secure as digital transactions, where disputes are minimized through transparent records, and where property markets operate with unprecedented efficiency and trust.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Property Registration**: Register new properties with detailed information including address, description, and initial value
